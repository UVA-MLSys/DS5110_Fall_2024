## Steps Taken and Assumptions

<details><summary>Steps taken and assumptions</summary>

## 1: Step Functions

Building Block and encompasses the Midterm Review

<details>
<summary> Expand to Learn More about Step Functions </summary>

This implementation is done with extensive help from Mils Taylor [and his video shown in class - requires a login - should be referenced.](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/121565/pages/week-5-chapter-5?module_item_id=1220355)

### `Introduction`

This initial part of the Big Data Systems Semester project, introduces Workflow Orchestration and the key part of any project which is optimizing the Budget.

The goal of the Semester Project is to develop a `Proof of Concept Model`. to do so requires being able to show and mimic the scale while being mindful of costs (large EC2 instances can be costly)

In addition to cost considerations, Lambda Functions can be scaled down to zero when there is zero work while EC2 compute instances need to be managed and shut down /manually destroyed.

While the AWS Lambda environment is highly constrained environment it [can cheaply mimic a HPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08763)

some of the infrastructure to run this experiment that is provided by the class include:

- a deployed Rendezvous sever deployed as `rendezvous.uva-ds5110.com`
- and a useable Registered Docker Image

These can be seen on the left side of the image below.

We can build the following part of an infrastructure.

![img/Using_Mils_slide_to_show.png](img/using_Mils_slide_to_show.png)

>[!TIP]
 To run this locally you'll need the Docker Image, if building an Image from scratch or for a new application include make and Python 3.9+

 to get the Python library installed see below

```bash
# a needed dependency might be the fmi python library
# see the fmi github
git clone https://github.com/mstaylor/fmi
cd python
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Step Function Experimental Design

The State Machine took in several parts

including

1) an event (were manually started)
2) the number of Lambda functions to test (also known as worlds)
3) a script places on S3 (locally here scripts/fmi-test.py)
4) settings in a json format (scripts/fmi.json)

The DAG for the job is the following

![test](img/stepfunctions_graph.png)

### `Beyond the original specifications`

Multiple World sizes were tested in order to give us an idea of the appropriate scale needed.

### `Results`

#### Time to Run for Different World Sizes

| World Size | Run Time, sec |
|------|------|
| 2 | 4.846 |
| 4 | 4.635 |
| 20 | 5.029 |
| 50 | 6.877 |

#### Memory Costs

| Memory | Duration | Cost |
|------|------|------|
| 128 MB | 11.722 s | $0.024628 |
| 512 MB | 6.678 s | $0.028035 |
| 1024 MB | 3.194 s | $0.026830 |
| 1536 MB | 1.465 s | $0.024638 |

- an equivalent EC2 instance could be 3-5 dollars and has start up and tear down time and the potential to have unused compute running up a large bill
  
### Step 1: Conclusions

Using the FMI State Machines we've successfully deployed a cheap infrastructure to build our POC and simulate a real deployment.

Plus or minus some costs for startup costs and variability in cloud infrastructure start ups the provisioning of these systems is
$$T_n = \theta(log(n))$$

as can be seen in the graph below of World size (Lambda inputs) and Runtime in seconds

![Nick's Runtime Graph](img/runtime_graph.png)

Which provides us with an easy and cheap way to scale.

>[!NOTE]
> Additional Notes
>
>- limited by the upper run time of an AWS Lambda Function (15 minutes)
>- limited to one script that has to be in an AWS S3 bucket
>- Output is sent to AWS Cloud Watch Log and should be examined using a log parser

compare different data sizes, and call sizes of the step functions

## 2: Rendezvous Server

<details>

<summary> Expand to learn more about the Rendevous Server </summary>

Taken from [preclass assignment](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/121565/assignments/571382?module_item_id=1318706)

The Faas Message Interface(FMI) uses the TCPunch

Links to an external site. communication library and Rendezvous server to establish socket communication between ($n$) AWS Lambda functions.
To run `FMI Python scripts` like is needed for the Astronomy Inference at Scale, it is necessary to deploy a Rendezvous Server on the public internet.

The `UVA DS5110` AWS account (TODO: link here) has includes a prebuilt Docker image that can be used.

### Steps Taken

1) go to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
2) select `rendezvous-tcpunch-fargate-task from the list and select rendezvous-tcpunch-fargate-task:1`
3) Select the Deploy option, Select the fargate1 cluster and select the launch type as FARGATE.
4) Scroll down to the Networking section and choose the open access security group as the only security group associated with this task.
5) Select Create at the bottom of the page
6) After the Rendezvous server starts, you will need to extract the public ip address from the task. We will use that as the IP address for the A Route 53 record.
7) Navigate to the AWS Route 53 service, select the uva-ds5110.com hosted zone, and update the rendezvous.uva-ds5110.com record with the IP Address retrieved from the previous step.

### Setting the Device

To run the script on either GPU or CPU, set the --device argument accordingly:

- For GPU: use `cuda`
- For CPU: use `cpu` (default)

To change the device, modify the --device argument as follows:

```python
    parser.add_argument('--device', type=str, default='cpu', help="Device to run the model on: 'cuda' for GPU or 'cpu' for CPU")
```

## 4: Cosmic AI with Lambda FMI

<details>
<summary>Expand to Learn More about Cosmic AI and the Lambda FMI</summary>

An AWS Step function has been developed to facilate orchestration of AI For Astronomy Serverless Inference. Step functions are represented as state machines and tasks. For the DS5110 class, the cosmicai state machine has been created. This step function takes an input payload and generates appropriate AWS Lambda fmi_executor payloads

In this payload we use world_size to represent the number of lambda functions to invoke, bucket to represent the S3 bucket that contains the fmi python script, S3_object_name to represent the path on the S3 bucket where the script can be found, data_path to represent where the resized_inference.pt can be founder, and script to represent the inference script.

![FMI image](img/fmi_image.png)

```json
# payload

# double check permissions on bucket
# will time out after 15 minutes

{
  "bucket": "Group4-cosmicai", 
  "world_size": "1",
  "object_type": "folder",
  "S3_object_name": "scripts/Anomaly Detection",
  "data_path": "/tmp/scripts/Anomaly Detection/Inference/resized_inference.pt",
  "script": "/tmp/scripts/Anomaly Detection/Inference/inference.py"
}

```

To edit the input payload:

- Navigate to the AWS Step Function service
- Select the `cosmicai` state machine
- Select edit to edit the state machine
- Select the Lambda init state
- On the right, scroll to the payload section

### 4 Steps

1) Create an S3 bucket that will host your python script

- the one we created is `team4-cosmicai`

2) Create `result` and `scripts` folders in this S3 Bucket

3) Clone the following repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mstaylor/AI-for-Astronomy.git #fork

```

4) Copy the Anomaly Detection folder located under code to the S3 bucket
Execute the step function

5) view the execution logs by navigating to the following Cloudwatch Log Group: `/aws/lambda/cosmic-executor`

Results of the collective reduce operation are post to the S3 Bucket's result folder under 0 (rank zero), you can see an example below

```json
 "data_map": {
        "0": "Anomaly Detection/Fine_Tune_Model/Mixed_Inception_z_VITAE_Base_Img_Full_New_Full.pt",
        "1": "data/1.pt"
    }
```

### 4 Results

## Results

Some Research already done by the TA [aws/](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy/tree/main/aws)

### Testing Step Functions


* Using FMI state machines, we were able to successfully deploy a relatively cheap infrastructure to build our POC and simulate a real deployment​

* Accounting for some variability in startup costs (in either direction), and variability in cloud infrastructure, the provisioning of these systems is Tn=𝜽(log(n))​

This is evidenced in the graph to the below, mapping world size to runtime​
This provides us with a cheap and easy way to scale​

![Step Function Graph](docs/imgs/step_functions_results.png)

The modular design allowed us to seamlessly leverage other AWS services, including most importantly Lambda and S3​

The flexibility of the state machine enabled us to experiment with key parameters which proved the scalability of the infrastructure​


### Local Baseline Testing

![Local Baseline Testing](docs/imgs/Local_Baseline_testing.png)

* Increasing the Batch Size decreased  the total CPU time and total memory used (less passes) but had diminishing returns on effectiveness​

* The point before diminishing return was either 1024 or 2048, more testing would be needed due to natural variability of runs.​

* The baseline data was ~64M

### Lambda Performance Summary


![Lambda Performance Summary](docs/imgs/lambda_performance_summary.png)


## Testing at Scale Experimental Design

The system proved to be cost-efficient by scaling work across multiple Lambda instances​

Costs decreased as batch sizes increased as a result of reduced overhead​

Even with varying batch sizes and dataset sizes, our experiments generally showed consistent scaling performance​

Overall, our infrastructure proved scalable and efficient for processing large datasets, validating its applicability for real-world use cases
